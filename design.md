## Overview

Developer portfolio, full-stack, projects gallery, clean layout, minimal, dark and cyan, code, tech stack, personal brand. Ideal for landing pages, modern websites. AI-ready template. Developer portfolios used to be an afterthought. A WordPress theme, maybe a Behance page if you were feeling fancy. Then GitHub became the resume. Contribution graphs, pinned repos, README aesthetics — suddenly your commit history was your portfolio. The personal site felt redundant for a while.

Then the pendulum swung. Developers realized a grid of green squares doesn't communicate taste. The terminal aesthetic emerged — monospace type, dark backgrounds, blinking cursors, ASCII art headers. It was a way to say "I live in the command line" without saying it. Some went minimal to the point of hostility. Others built elaborate interactive CLIs in the browser. Both were statements.

What's interesting now is the full-stack developer portfolio as proof of craft. The site itself is the project. How it loads, how it deploys, what framework it uses — recruiters might not notice, but other developers will. The portfolio became a technical flex disguised as a personal page. Your stack choices are your design choices.

- No AI copywriting clichés: "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next-Gen"
- No broken external image links — use picsum.photos or inline SVG
- No generic lorem ipsum in demos

- Do Navbar + Hero (bio + CTA)
- Do Projetos + Stack/Skills
- Do Experiência + Depoimentos
- Do CTA 'Fale comigo'
- Do Meta tags SEO
